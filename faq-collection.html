<div id="general" class="section level3">
<h3>General</h3>
<div
id="what-if-two-experimenters-want-to-go-on-the-visit-for-safety-reasons"
class="section level5">
<h5>What if two experimenters want to go on the visit for safety
reasons?</h5>
<ul>
<li>The protocol and funding model was designed for one experimenter to
complete a visit. However, if the site investigator can afford and
organize having two experimenters on a visit, two people may go.</li>
<li>Both experimenters should go to the family’s home and be present
during consenting.</li>
<li>The second experimenter should wait outside the home (in the car,
coffee shop, library, etc.) while the primary experimenter records the
1-hour natural interaction.</li>
<li>A second person in the home can distract the child, obstruct
movement, block off access to a space or room, or affect the naturalness
of the interaction. Therefore, visits with another experimenter in the
home during that time will not pass quality assurance.</li>
<li>After the 1-hour interaction, the second experimenter can return to
the home to assist in the rest of the visit.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-if-fatherpartnerauntnannyetc.-is-there"
class="section level5">
<h5>What if father/partner/aunt/nanny/etc. is there?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Usually mom says other person is going to leave.<br />
</li>
<li>If mom doesn’t appear to send them out, then say: <say>We just want
to double check that you’re ok with being alone with the child for the
first 90 minutes of this visit. As we mentioned earlier, we just want
you and your child at home. Let us know when you’re ready for it to just
be you and your child. If they needs more time to leave, we could start
with questionnaires. </say></li>
<li>If other person needs to be in another room in the home, we want to
make sure they will not interrupt the mom and child or interact with
them.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-if-child-is-sleeping-when-i-get-there"
class="section level5">
<h5>What if child is sleeping when I get there?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Do the questionnaire first.</li>
<li>Start one-hour natural play recording as soon as child wakes.</li>
<li>It is alright to stop questionnaire and then resume later after
recording interactions.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div
id="where-is-the-best-place-to-put-my-equipment-and-personal-items-before-we-start"
class="section level5">
<h5>Where is the best place to put my equipment and personal items
before we start?</h5>
<ul>
<li>The child should not have access to anything the experimenter brings
into the home. That is not something they would typically access in
their daily life and they cannot play with it during the one-hour
natural play or have it take up space in their home environment during
the house walkthrough. The session will fail quality assurance if these
items are left out.</li>
<li>Optimally, you should put anything you bring into the home in a
closet or somewhere with a door. Otherwise, tucked in a corner or behind
furniture where the child cannot access it is okay.</li>
<li>Placing those items on a counter, table, or somewhere the mom or
child might use during the one-hour natural play is not advised.</li>
<li>If at any point during the one-hour natural play the mom or child
tries to interact with those outside items, please move them to a more
hidden spot and advise the mom to leave them alone.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div
id="at-any-point-during-the-visit-what-if-there-are-technical-issues-with-the-video-camera"
class="section level5">
<h5>At any point during the visit, what if there are technical issues
with the video camera?</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>If the camera won’t turn on or record:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check that the SD card is inserted correctly and there is enough
storage to record.</li>
<li>Check that the battery is charged (replace with backup).</li>
<li>Try turning the camera off and on using the Power button on the side
of the camera.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If the record stops because of full storage, you can delete old
recordings to free up space.</p></li>
<li><p>If the battery runs out or recording stops during the
<strong>house walkthrough, structured play, or questionnaires</strong>,
replace the battery and resume recording. Upload all of the recordings
to Databrary.</p></li>
<li><p>If the battery runs out or recording stops during the
<strong>one-hour natural play</strong>, replace the battery or free up
storage space and start the 1 hour over. (Ensure you will have enough
battery power to record the rest of the home visit.) If the mom does not
have enough time to start over, then reschedule the visit for another
time (pay the mom for both sessions).</p></li>
<li><p>If a technical issue keeps you from starting or completing the
session (e.g., battery runs out and backup was forgotten, camera
completely malfunctions), reschedule the visit for another time (pay the
mom for both sessions).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Contact the PLAY team for assistance.</p>
<div
id="what-happens-if-i-need-to-reschedule-a-visit-while-im-on-a-home-visit"
class="section level5">
<h5>What happens if I need to reschedule a visit while I’m on a home
visit</h5>
<ul>
<li>Try to reschedule for within the next 1-2 days if possible.</li>
<li>Make sure the child still will be within the age window (within 1
month of 12, 18, or 24 months) on the new test date.</li>
<li>The Test Date on Databrary should be the date the 1-hour natural
play was done (so update it if needed). Keep the same subject
number.</li>
<li>Give the mother participant payment in full amount on both
visits.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-if-mom-offers-you-food-or-drink-or-anything-else"

<div id="what-if-i-need-to-go-to-the-bathroom-during-the-visit"
class="section level5">
<h5>What if I need to go to the bathroom during the visit?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Do not. Plan your bathroom breaks around the visit (it will be
approx 2.5 hrs long).</li>
<li>If it is an emergency, ask very politely to go in between the
different portions of the visit.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div

outside, bathroom, etc.?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Say: <say>For legal reasons, I cannot assume responsibility for your
child.</say></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div
id="what-if-mom-ends-the-session-early-and-you-didnt-finish-everything"
class="section level5">
<h5>What if mom ends the session early and you didn’t finish
everything?</h5>
<ul>
<li>The mom can decide to stop at any point and still receive
participant payment. Please respect her wishes.</li>
<li>Try to finish the one-hour natural play. Do your best to record the
house walkthrough if you can (especially main living space and child’s
room or sleeping area, clothes, toys, etc.)</li>
<li>If you are unable to complete the questionnaires, you can set up a
time to do so on a recorded video chat. (See directions below for how to
record a video chat session).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div
id="at-any-point-during-the-visit-what-if-the-experimenter-feels-unsafe-or-uncomfortable"
class="section level5">
<h5>At any point during the visit, what if the experimenter feels unsafe
or uncomfortable?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Experimenter’s safety should be considered above the completion of
the home visit.<br />
</li>
<li>Explain to mom that you are feeling unwell and cannot complete the
visit. Remember to be apologetic and professional while doing so (For
example, <say> I’m not feeling great right now. I’m so sorry but I don’t
think that I will be able to finish the rest of the visit. I’m really
sorry for the inconvenience. </say>)<br />
</li>
<li>If mom has already signed the study permission form, experimenter
should still provide subject payment (if possible) before leaving. (For
example, <say> Again, I’m really sorry about this. We will definitely
still pay you for this visit though. Can you please sign this
form?</say>)<br />
</li>
<li>Experimenter should make a note of what happened in the post-visit
notes.</li>

</div>
<div id="one-hour-natural-play" class="section level3">
<h3>One-hour natural play</h3>
<div id="what-if-the-mom-wants-to-go-outside" class="section level5">
<h5>What if the mom wants to go outside?</h5>
<p>Say <say>You can go anywhere inside your home. We ask that you not go
outside. Not every family will have an outside space or the weather may
not be good that day. We want to try to keep things consistent for
everyone.</say></p>
<p>-We consider yards, stoops, common hallways, porches, balconies, and
decks to be outside spaces. -We consider fully enclosed (roof and all
sides) sunrooms, indoor pool rooms (e.g., Florida rooms), lanai,
3-season rooms, etc. to be “inside.” -However, if they have to leave the
main home to get to the space, it doesn’t count as “inside.” -Unfinished
garages count as outside. Finished/converted garages with carpet or play
mats count as “inside” if you can get to it from the main house without
going outside.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-if-the-child-or-mom-with-child-goes-outside"
class="section level5">
<h5>What if the child (or mom with child) goes outside?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Continue recording the entryway from inside the home and wait for
them to come back.</li>
<li>If they have been outside for longer than 30 seconds or the mom is
not redirecting child inside, remind the mom that we want them to stay
inside the home for the one-hour natural play.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div
id="what-should-i-do-if-the-mom-or-child-plays-with-the-equipment-or-experimenters-items"
class="section level5">
<h5>What should I do if the mom or child plays with the equipment or
experimenter’s items?</h5>
<ul>
<li>These outside items should have been placed in a closet or hidden
away corner before starting.</li>
<li>If they were left out, please move them to a place out of view and
inaccessible to the child and advise the mom to leave them alone.</li>
<li>It’s okay to stop their activity to move the items. If the child
plays with the equipment more than a few times, this will result in the
visit failing quality assurance.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-if-child-falls-asleep-in-middle-of-hour-of-recording"
class="section level5">
<h5>What if child falls asleep in middle of hour of recording?</h5>
<ul>
<li>If child is noticeably sleepy: <say>It’s okay if he/she needs to
take a nap. We can just complete the questionnaires now and see if he
wakes up afterwards to do the one-hour natural recording. If not, can we
reschedule our visit?”</say></li>
<li>You will need a full, uninterrupted one-hour recording of natural
play. So start the recording over when the child is awake.</li>
<li>If the child falls asleep in the last 5 mins, record the mom putting
the child to sleep for the rest of the 1 hour video.</li>

<div id="what-if-mom-interacts-with-you" class="section level5">
<h5>What if mom interacts with you?</h5>

to go about their day as if you’re not there.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-if-mom-is-talking-about-or-to-me" class="section level5">
<h5>What if mom is talking about or to me?</h5>

<li>Ignore it at first. If it continues, quickly and quietly remind mom
that you want them to go about their day as if you’re not there.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-if-the-child-keeps-trying-to-interact-with-me"
class="section level5">
<h5>What if the child keeps trying to interact with me?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Don’t look directly at the child. Look at them through video
recording screen.</li>
<li>Children will usually try to do this during the first 5-10 mins of
your visit. Do not interact with them.</li>
<li>If child tries to hand you something, stay still and do not take it.
If child is looking at you, do not move. You may need to stay still and
record from a distance to show them you aren’t fun or interesting or
responding to them.</li>
<li>Try to put space between you and child. Moving onto the child’s
level to record them may entice them to interact.</li>
<li>Do not laugh, smile, or acknowledge what the child or mom is
doing.</li>
<li>Be sure to make notes in Clean Up about child interaction.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-if-doorbell-rings-for-the-dog-walker-delivery-etc."
class="section level5">
<h5>What if doorbell rings for the dog walker, delivery, etc.?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Do not record the person coming. Try to record child and mom from a
discrete angle. If unable to do so without also capturing the other
person, record the floor during that time so we can account for that
time.</li>
<li>If mom asks to stop recording, ask to just record the floor or go to
a different room so we have a continuous recording and account for how
long that disruption occurred.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-if-mom-goes-to-the-bathroom" class="section level5">
<h5>What if mom goes to the bathroom?</h5>
<ul>
<li>The mom will usually take child in with her. Keep the camera
recording from the outside. Record the closed door, or the floor (if the
door isn’t completely closed). It is important to keep the camera
running so we know how long they were in there.</li>
<li>If mom asks you to watch child: <say>We are not allowed to watch
him/her for you, but you can take him/her into the bathroom with
you.</say></li>

<ul>
<li>If the experimenter is unable to go over all the questionnaires
during the visit (because the mother does not have time, the child is
irritable and mother asks to finish, or there is another reason why you
cannot continue) schedule a video call to complete remotely. The
Databrary form MUST be completed in the home at the end of the
visit.</li>
<li>Guidelines for completing the questionnaires on a video call:
<ul>
<li>The call must be done within <strong>48 hours</strong> of the home
visit.</li>
<li>Remind the mother of the agreement level she signed on the Databrary
form and confirm that she agrees to share the video call with the rest
of the data. Say <say>Just as a reminder, the videos collected today are
part of the data we collected during our home visit. You agreed to share
the data on Databrary, an online video library where only authorized
researchers have access, with other RESEARCHERS (AND IMAGES FOR
PRESENTATIONS [IF APPLIES]). Do you agree to share this video recording
as part of the data?</say></li>
<li>Video call must be <strong>recorded</strong> with mom in view and
uploaded with the rest of the data from the visit. Label the file as
<b>PLAY_SITE_###_Questionnaires_remote</b>
(e.g. PLAY_NYUNI_024_Questionnaires_remote)</li>
<li>Share your screen so that the mother can see the questionnaires and
scales when it applies.</li>
<li>Setup the Zoom so you are the host. Click on the 3 dots (…) in the
upper right hand corner on the mother’s Zoom window. Select “Rename” and
change her name to ‘Participant’. (This will blind the participant’s
name from being shown on the recording.)</li>
<li>The questionnaire must be completed on the same KoBoToolBox session
and form that was started in the home.</li>
