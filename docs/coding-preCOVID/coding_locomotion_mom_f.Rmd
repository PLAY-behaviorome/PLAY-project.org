<h5>General rules for coding "<b>f</b>" for mom</h5>

Code 'f' if the mom loses control over her body (i.e., balance) and cannot recover on her own before the body (bum, hands, torso) hits the ground.
<br><br>
All falls count. They can happen while upright, on/off furniture or other elevation, while sitting, or while engaged in locomotion.
<br><br>
From an upright or squatting position: a loss of balance results in the hands, knees, or a toy in the hands hitting the ground.
