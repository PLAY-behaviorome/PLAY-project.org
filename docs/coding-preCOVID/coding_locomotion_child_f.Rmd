<h5>General rules for coding "<b>f</b>"</h5>
Code <b>f</b> if the baby loses control over his/her body (i.e., balance) and cannot recover on his/her own before his/her body hits the ground. If the baby loses balance, but catches him/herself before the above body parts hit the ground, do not count as a fall.
<br><br>
All falls count. They can happen while upright, on/off furniture or other elevation, while sitting, or while engaged in locomotion (walking or crawling). Falls can happen while the mom is holding the baby's hand or while the baby is holding onto furniture or another support. 
<br><br>
A loss of balance must occur before any of the body parts hit the ground. The baby must be out of his/her own control. Sometimes babies will actively choose to drop to the floor (e.g., jumping and dropping, flopping down from a couch to the floor, plopping down into a sit, where they let themselves fall down into a sitting position) should NOT count as a fall.
<br><br>
Parent involved falls would only be coded as a fall if the parent catches the baby after the baby loses balance, effectively supporting the baby's entire weight. In this scenario, the baby would have fallen if not for parent rescue (i.e., the body part would have hit the ground). Parents must catch after the baby has begun to lose balance. If the parent was already supporting the baby's weight before a loss of balance, but baby's body parts (e.g., hands, head, butt, etc.) do not touch the ground, then this is not a fall (it is supported walking). 
<br><br>
Falling can occur immediately after mom-constrained if mom and child fell together. Falling can occur immediately after device-constrained if device tips over or the mechanism of constraint fails. Falling can occur immediately after riding if falls off of the riding device.
<br>

<h5>Setting the Onset & Offset for falls:</h5>
Falls can be coded as separate events (child is standing stationary and then falls) or immediately following another code (child is locomoting and then falls). There should only be 1ms between the previous code and the onset of the falling event if the fall ends the previous code.
<br>
<indent><b>Onset</b> is the first frame when child begins to lose balance.</indent><br>
<indent><b>Offset</b> when child's body (as defined below) hits the floor.</indent>
<br>
<br>
From an <b>upright or squatting</b> position: a loss of balance results in the hands, knees, or a toy in the hands hitting the ground; baby's bum hitting the ground; or head hitting the ground.
<br>
From a <b>crawling</b> position: a loss of balance results in the face, head, chest, or side of torso hitting the ground.
<br>
From a <b>sitting</b> position: a loss of balance results in the head, chest, side of torso, or back hitting the ground.
