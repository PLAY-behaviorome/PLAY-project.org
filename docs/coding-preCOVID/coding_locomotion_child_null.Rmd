<h5>General rules for coding "<b>.</b>"</h5>
Code <b>.</b> if child is not fully visible and you cannot reliably code <b>l</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>m</b>, or <b>r</b>. Child could be completely out of view or their lower body could be occluded and it is not clear based of the movement of the top half of the body if the child is locomoting. <b>A missing bout must last for last least 1 second</b>.
<br><br><b>If child is missing for less than 1s</b>:
<br>If missing time less than 1s occurs between 2 identical codes (e.g. ‘l’ and ‘l’) <b>do not split bout</b>; instead, continue locomotion bout from original cell until end of that locomotion bout.
<br>If missing time (<1s) occurs between 2 non-identical codes, (e.g. ‘l’ before missing, stationary after missing), code offset of locomotion cell as the first frame where you cannot see the child.
<br><br><b>If child is missing for more than 1s</b>:
Code CONTINUOUSLY so that the ‘.’ fills all of the time in the spreadsheet between the two events that are visible. For example, if child is locomoting, then feet aren’t visible, and the reapers constrained in a car seat, there should only be 1ms between the cells (press the ‘0’ key on the numpad to do this automatically). 
<br><br><b>Going around corners</b>:
This should be coded according to above rules. After child is fully out of view (and this lasts for at least 1s), code as missing. Begin coding locomotion again when child is back in view. This is a continuous code (see above for when missing (>1s) captures all time between two cells).
<br><br><b>If child’s lower half is occluded by furniture or is outside of camera view:</b>
<br>If this occurs BUT you can easily see that the child is locomoting over distance (e.g. by seeing top half of child moving in space), DO NOT code as ‘.’ because this is locomoting. If this occurs BUT you cannot determine if child is taking steps (e.g. could be taking small steps, rocking back and forth, or pivoting), locomotion status is unclear <b>so code as missing</b>. Do not make judgment calls if you cannot clearly determine if locomotion is taking place. 
<h5>Setting the Onset & Offset of a missing bout:</h5>
<b>Onset</b> of missing is first frame where child’s locomotion cannot be reliably coded (see above rules for specific instances).
<br><b>Offset</b> of missing is first frame where child’s locomotion status can reliably be coded (see above rules for specific instances).
