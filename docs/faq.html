<div id="if-mom-asks-if-she-needs-to-be-alone-during-the-study-and-if-fatherauntnannyetc.-can-be-anywhere-at-home-during-the-study" class="section level5">
<h5>If mom asks if she needs to be alone during the study, and if father/aunt/nanny/etc. can be anywhere at home during the study</h5>
<p><say>For the first 90 minutes of this study, we are interested in how mothers and children interact. It should only be you and your child during the first half of our visit. If father/aunt/nanny/etc isn’t able to stay out of the home for the full time that we’re there, they can come back for the last hour.</say></p>
</div>
<div id="if-mom-specifically-says-that-the-fatheranyone-works-at-home-and-that-its-inconvenient-for-them-to-leave" class="section level5">
<h5>If mom specifically says that the father/anyone works at home and that it’s inconvenient for them to leave</h5>
<p><say>We really want just mom and child in the house during the first half of the visit. If there is a separate room with a door that the child never goes into (and that the father/person wouldn’t leave anytime during the first half of the visit), then it’s ok. But, if it’s only a corner of the room of if the child.</say></p>
</div>
<div id="what-if-phone-questionnaire-was-not-done-before-home-visit" class="section level5">
<h5>What if phone questionnaire was not done before home visit?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Ideally this should be completed before the visit, over the phone, because some of these questions will ensure eligibility of the family to participate<br />
</li>
<li>Complete it right before the other questionnaires but <em>do not record this portion</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="mom-says-she-needs-to-ask-childs-father-about-participating" class="section level5">
<h5>Mom says she needs to ask child’s father about participating</h5>
<p><say>Sure, we will send you an email about what the study is about and include the permission forms that we will have you sign. Would it be alright if we called you back in 2-3 days?</say></p>
<ul>
<li>Setup time to call back.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="parent-unsure-about-sharing-videos" class="section level5">
<h5>Parent unsure about sharing videos</h5>
<p><say>Video data like this is incredibly valuable for us and other developmental researchers around the country.<br />
To participate in this study, we would ask to be able to share the video with other developmental researchers, like the professor who runs our lab. The goal is to make what we learn from you and your baby available to other scientists. We won’t share anything publicly unless you agree to it. On our permission forms, there are two levels of permission and you can indicate whatever you are comfortable with. If you want, we can send you an email with a copy of the form for you to look over. Can I give you a call back in 2-3 days to see if you would be interested in participating?</say></p>
<ul>
<li>If parent still does not want to share video, <em><strong>do not schedule them</strong></em>.</li>

<div id="how-far-can-we-go-to-visit-a-family-for-a-home-visit" class="section level5">
<h5>How far can we go to visit a family for a home visit?</h5>
<ul>
<li>The only restriction is that the family must live in the same state as the site. It is up to the PI and research team what the maximum distance they want to travel is. Depending on the location, some sites may have longer commute times than others.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="are-travel-expenses-i.e.public-transportation-or-gas-reimbursed" class="section level5">
<h5>Are travel expenses (i.e. public transportation or gas) reimbursed?</h5>

<h5>What if father/partner/aunt/nanny/etc. is there when experimenter gets there?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Usually mom says [PERSON] is going to leave.<br />
</li>
<li>If mom doesn’t appear to send [PERSON] out, then say: <say>We just want to double check that you’re ok with being alone with the child for the first 90 minutes of this visit. As we mentioned earlier, we just want you and your child at home. If [PERSON] needs more time to leave, we could start with questionnaires. </say></li>

<li>You learn something about child’s or mom’s health that excludes them from the study</li>
<li>Mom or child engages in some other behavior that would invalidate the visit</li>
</ul>
<p>Conduct the study as usual, complete all steps in procedure. The participant won’t count toward the 30 good participants but parts of the video and questionnaires will be usable to someone.</p>
</div>
<div id="at-any-point-during-the-visit-what-if-there-are-technical-issues-with-the-equipment" class="section level5">
<h5>At any point during the visit, what if there are technical issues with the equipment?</h5>
<ul>
<li>If it occurs within approximately the first 15 minutes of the study, ask the mom if it would be possible to reschedule. Remember to be apologetic and professional.<br />
</li>
<li>If it occurs in the middle of the session, continue with the rest of the visit to the best of your ability and if necessary, “fake” the recording. Experimenter should make note of what happened in the post-visit notes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="at-any-point-during-the-visit-what-if-the-experimenter-feels-unsafe-or-uncomfortable" class="section level5">

<ul>
<li>Experimenter’s safety should be considered above the completion of the home visit.<br />
</li>
<li>Explain to mom that you are feeling unwell and cannot complete the visit. Remember to be apologetic and professional while doing so (For example, <say> I’m not feeling great right now. I’m so sorry but I don’t think that I will be able to finish the rest of the visit. I’m really sorry for the inconvenience. </say>)<br />
</li>
<li>If mom has already signed the study permission form, experimenter should still provide subject payment (if possible) before leaving. (For example, <say> Again, I’m really sorry about this. We will definitely still pay you for this visit though. Can you please sign this form?</say>)<br />

<li>Experimenter should make a note of what happened in the post-visit notes.</li>

<h5>What if child gets naked or gets a diaper change?</h5>
