<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> The easiest way to find answers to your
question is to “Find” (<code>Cmd+F</code> on a Mac or
<code>Ctrl+F</code> on Windows) and type the simplest form of the word
you’re looking for. For example, searching for the word <code>dog</code>
will bring up the FAQ “What if doorbell rings for the dog walker,
delivery, etc.?”</p>

<h2>FAQ about scheduling and recruitment</h2>
<div
id="mom-says-the-child-hears-other-languages.-what-factors-decide-if-the-child-can-participate"
class="section level5">
<h5>Mom says the child hears other languages. What factors decide if the
child can participate?</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>The main consideration is what language(s) are spoken to the
child in the home, and what language(s) does the mom ever speak to the
child (at home, while shopping, elsewhere, etc.). If the child is spoken
to at home or by the mom in anything other than English and/or Spanish
they are not eligible.</p></li>
<li><p>Sign language (as it is not a verbal language) is permissible for
the child to hear.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning a handful of words, conventional phrases, or expressions
(e.g., “good morning,” “thank you,” “hello,” religious terms, food) in
another language is allowed. There is no hard cap, but 10 or fewer words
is probably fine.</p></li>
<li><p>If the child hears languages other than English/Spanish
<strong>outside the home</strong> (at daycare, visiting family, etc.;
not from the mom), that is allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>If the child occasionally hears other languages while at home,
<strong>from someone who does not live there or infrequently visits
(e.g., aunt visits once a week or so)</strong>, that is
allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>If the child hears other languages while at home, <strong>from
someone who lives there (e.g., grandma lives with them) or visits
frequently (e.g., nanny comes 3-4 days a week, cousin comes after school
every day)</strong>, that would make them ineligible. That is, they are
experiencing regular input (3-4 days) and would not qualify.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if the mom or household member is just “exposing” them to
the language (letting them hear it as an experience, familiarizing them
to it, etc.), that would make them ineligible. The child can’t
distinguish “exposure” from actually learning it.</p></li>
<li><p>If the child (because of any language experiences) speaks a
language other than English/Spanish, they cannot participate. That is,
even if mom doesn’t speak that language and no one at home speaks that
language, the child may naturally speak it during the home visit, so
they are ineligible.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The scientific rationale is that all sessions will be transcribed,
and PLAY only has English and Spanish transcribers. The mom or child
cannot be artificially asked to speak in only some languages; we want
their natural speech. The above rules are complicated, but were designed
to allow more families to participate, instead of excluding them with
simpler rules.</p>

<div
id="if-mom-asks-if-she-needs-to-be-alone-during-the-study-and-if-fatherauntnannyetc.-can-be-anywhere-at-home-during-the-study"
class="section level5">
<h5>If mom asks if she needs to be alone during the study, and if
father/aunt/nanny/etc. can be anywhere at home during the study</h5>
<p><say>For the first 90 minutes of this study, we are interested in how
mothers and children interact. It should only be you and your child
during the first half of our visit. If father/aunt/nanny/etc isn’t able
to stay out of the home for the full time that we’re there, they can
come back for the last hour. But we want you to be the one that answers
the questionnaires.</say></p>
</div>
<div id="how-far-can-we-go-to-visit-a-family-for-a-home-visit"
class="section level5">
<h5>How far can we go to visit a family for a home visit?</h5>
<ul>
<li>It is up to the PI and research team what the maximum distance they
want to travel is. Depending on the location, some sites may have longer
commute times than others.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div
id="are-travel-expenses-i.e.-public-transportation-or-gas-reimbursed"

<h5>Are travel expenses (i.e. public transportation or gas)

covered and how to obtain reimbursements.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div
id="if-mom-specifically-says-that-the-fatheranyone-works-at-home-and-that-its-inconvenient-for-them-to-leave"
class="section level5">
<h5>If mom specifically says that the father/anyone works at home and
that it’s inconvenient for them to leave</h5>
<p><say>We really want just mom and child in the house during the first
half of the visit. If there is a separate room with a door that the
child never goes into (and that the father/person wouldn’t leave anytime
during the first half of the visit), then it’s ok. But, if the
father/person would be in an open room or somewhere your child has
access to, we need to find a time when it’s just you and your child for
that first half.</say></p>
</div>
<div id="what-if-phone-questionnaire-was-not-done-before-home-visit"
class="section level5">
<h5>What if phone questionnaire was not done before home visit?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Ideally this should be completed before the visit, over the phone,
because some of these questions will ensure eligibility of the family to
participate<br />
</li>
<li>Complete it right before the other questionnaires in the home but
<em>do not record this portion</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="mom-says-she-needs-to-ask-childs-father-about-participating"

<h5>Mom says she needs to ask child’s father about participating</h5>
<p><say>Sure, we will send you an email about what the study is about
and include the permission forms that we will have you sign. Would it be
alright if we called you back in 2-3 days?</say></p>
<ul>
<li>Arrange a time to call back.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="parent-unsure-about-sharing-videos" class="section level5">
<h5>Parent unsure about sharing videos</h5>
<p><say>Video data like this is incredibly valuable for us and other
developmental researchers around the country.<br />
To participate in this study, we would ask to be able to share the video
with other developmental researchers, like the professor who runs our
lab. The goal is to make what we learn from you and your baby available
to other scientists. On our permission forms, there are two levels of
permission and you can indicate whatever you are comfortable with. If
you want, we can send you an email with a copy of the form for you to
look over. Can I give you a call back in 2-3 days to see if you would be
interested in participating?</say></p>
<ul>
<li>If parent still does not want to share video, <em><strong>do not
schedule them</strong></em>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div
id="what-if-i-want-to-schedule-someone-as-a-pilot-session-who-does-not-meet-inclusion-criteria"
class="section level5">
<h5>What if I want to schedule someone as a “pilot” session who does not
meet inclusion criteria?</h5>
<ul>
<li>It’s okay to run a few practice sessions as a new experimenter.
Treat everything from scheduling through data collection and clean up
exactly as a normal session. Upload all videos to Databrary and mark the
session as pilot in the post-visit notes. Quality assurance and feedback
will still be given.</li>
<li>Give the mother the participant payment for a pilot visit exactly
like a real visit.</li>

their home yet?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the child still will be within the age window (within 1
month of 12, 18, or 24 months) on the new test date. Otherwise, you can
keep their contact information to schedule them later for the next age
window.</li>

month of 12, 18, or 24 months) on the new test date.</li>
<li>The Test Date on Databrary should be the date the 1-hour natural

class="section level5">
<h5>What if two experimenters want to go on the visit for safety
reasons?</h5>
<ul>
<li>The protocol and funding model was designed for one experimenter to
complete a visit. However, if the site investigator can afford and
organize having two experimenters on a visit, two people may go.</li>
<li>Both experimenters should go to the family’s home and be present
during consenting.</li>
<li>The second experimenter should wait outside the home (in the car,
coffee shop, library, etc.) while the primary experimenter records the
1-hour natural interaction.</li>
<li>A second person in the home can distract the child, obstruct
movement, block off access to a space or room, or affect the naturalness
of the interaction. Therefore, visits with another experimenter in the
home during that time will not pass quality assurance.</li>
<li>After the 1-hour interaction, the second experimenter can return to
the home to assist in the rest of the visit.</li>

to double check that you’re ok with being alone with the child for the
first 90 minutes of this visit. As we mentioned earlier, we just want
you and your child at home. Let us know when you’re ready for it to just
be you and your child. If they needs more time to leave, we could start
with questionnaires. </say></li>
<li>If other person needs to be in another room in the home, we want to
make sure they will not interrupt the mom and child or interact with
them.</li>

id="where-is-the-best-place-to-put-my-equipment-and-personal-items-before-we-start"
class="section level5">
<h5>Where is the best place to put my equipment and personal items
before we start?</h5>
<ul>
<li>The child should not have access to anything the experimenter brings
into the home. That is not something they would typically access in
their daily life and they cannot play with it during the one-hour
natural play or have it take up space in their home environment during
the house walkthrough. The session will fail quality assurance if these
items are left out.</li>
<li>Optimally, you should put anything you bring into the home in a
closet or somewhere with a door. Otherwise, tucked in a corner or behind
furniture where the child cannot access it is okay.</li>
<li>Placing those items on a counter, table, or somewhere the mom or
child might use during the one-hour natural play is not advised.</li>
<li>If at any point during the one-hour natural play the mom or child
tries to interact with those outside items, please move them to a more
hidden spot and advise the mom to leave them alone.</li>

<h5>At any point during the visit, what if there are technical issues
with the video camera?</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>If the camera won’t turn on or record:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check that the SD card is inserted correctly and there is enough
storage to record.</li>
<li>Check that the battery is charged (replace with backup).</li>
<li>Try turning the camera off and on using the Power button on the side
of the camera.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If the record stops because of full storage, you can delete old
recordings to free up space.</p></li>
<li><p>If the battery runs out or recording stops during the
<strong>house walkthrough, structured play, or questionnaires</strong>,
replace the battery and resume recording. Upload all of the recordings
to Databrary.</p></li>
<li><p>If the battery runs out or recording stops during the
<strong>one-hour natural play</strong>, replace the battery or free up
storage space and start the 1 hour over. (Ensure you will have enough
battery power to record the rest of the home visit.) If the mom does not
have enough time to start over, then reschedule the visit for another
time (pay the mom for both sessions).</p></li>
<li><p>If a technical issue keeps you from starting or completing the
session (e.g., battery runs out and backup was forgotten, camera
completely malfunctions), reschedule the visit for another time (pay the
mom for both sessions).</p></li>

3-season rooms, etc. to be “inside.” -However, if they have to leave the
main home to get to the space, it doesn’t count as “inside.” -Unfinished
