<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> The easiest way to find answers to your question is to “Find” (<code>Cmd+F</code> on a Mac or <code>Ctrl+F</code> on Windows) and type the simplest form of the word you’re looking for. For example, searching for the word <code>dog</code> will bring up the FAQ “What if doorbell rings for the dog walker, delivery, etc.?”</p>

<h2>FAQ about scheduling and recruitment</h2>
<div id="how-far-can-we-go-to-visit-a-family-for-a-home-visit" class="section level5">
<h5>How far can we go to visit a family for a home visit?</h5>
<ul>
<li>The only restriction is that the family must live in the same state as the site. It is up to the PI and research team what the maximum distance they want to travel is. Depending on the location, some sites may have longer commute times than others.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="are-travel-expenses-i.e.-public-transportation-or-gas-reimbursed" class="section level5">
<h5>Are travel expenses (i.e. public transportation or gas) reimbursed?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Please speak with your site PI about what travel expenses can be covered and how to obtain reimbursements.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="if-mom-asks-if-she-needs-to-be-alone-during-the-study-and-if-fatherauntnannyetc.-can-be-anywhere-at-home-during-the-study" class="section level5">
<h5>If mom asks if she needs to be alone during the study, and if father/aunt/nanny/etc. can be anywhere at home during the study</h5>
<p><say>For the first 90 minutes of this study, we are interested in how mothers and children interact. It should only be you and your child during the first half of our visit. If father/aunt/nanny/etc isn’t able to stay out of the home for the full time that we’re there, they can come back for the last hour.</say></p>
</div>
<div id="if-mom-specifically-says-that-the-fatheranyone-works-at-home-and-that-its-inconvenient-for-them-to-leave" class="section level5">
<h5>If mom specifically says that the father/anyone works at home and that it’s inconvenient for them to leave</h5>
<p><say>We really want just mom and child in the house during the first half of the visit. If there is a separate room with a door that the child never goes into (and that the father/person wouldn’t leave anytime during the first half of the visit), then it’s ok. But, if it’s only a corner of the room of if the child.</say></p>
</div>
<div id="what-if-phone-questionnaire-was-not-done-before-home-visit" class="section level5">
<h5>What if phone questionnaire was not done before home visit?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Ideally this should be completed before the visit, over the phone, because some of these questions will ensure eligibility of the family to participate<br />
</li>
<li>Complete it right before the other questionnaires but <em>do not record this portion</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="mom-says-she-needs-to-ask-childs-father-about-participating" class="section level5">
<h5>Mom says she needs to ask child’s father about participating</h5>
<p><say>Sure, we will send you an email about what the study is about and include the permission forms that we will have you sign. Would it be alright if we called you back in 2-3 days?</say></p>
<ul>
<li>Setup time to call back.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="parent-unsure-about-sharing-videos" class="section level5">
<h5>Parent unsure about sharing videos</h5>
<p><say>Video data like this is incredibly valuable for us and other developmental researchers around the country.<br />
To participate in this study, we would ask to be able to share the video with other developmental researchers, like the professor who runs our lab. The goal is to make what we learn from you and your baby available to other scientists. We won’t share anything publicly unless you agree to it. On our permission forms, there are two levels of permission and you can indicate whatever you are comfortable with. If you want, we can send you an email with a copy of the form for you to look over. Can I give you a call back in 2-3 days to see if you would be interested in participating?</say></p>
<ul>
<li>If parent still does not want to share video, <em><strong>do not schedule them</strong></em>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-if-i-want-to-schedule-someone-as-a-pilot-session-who-does-not-meet-inclusion-criteria" class="section level5">
<h5>What if I want to schedule someone as a “pilot” session who does not meet inclusion criteria?</h5>
<ul>
<li>It’s okay to run a few practice sessions as a new experimenter. Treat everything from scheduling through data collection and clean up exactly as a normal session. Upload all videos to Databrary and mark the session as pilot in the post-visit notes. Quality assurance and feedback will still be given.</li>
<li>Give the mother the participant payment for a pilot visit exactly like a real visit.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-happens-if-i-need-to-reschedule-a-visit-but-i-havent-been-to-their-home-yet" class="section level5">
<h5>What happens if I need to reschedule a visit, but I haven’t been to their home yet?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the child still will be within the age window (within 1 week of 12, 18, or 24 months) on the new test date. Otherwise, you can keep their contact information to schedule them later for the next age window.</li>
<li>Update the Test Date on Databrary for that session. Keep the same subject number.</li>
<li>You DO NOT need to send participant payment for the rescheduled or canceled visit.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-happens-if-i-need-to-reschedule-a-visit-while-im-on-a-home-visit-because-something-happened-with-equipment-or-participants" class="section level5">
<h5>What happens if I need to reschedule a visit while I’m on a home visit (because something happened with equipment or participants)</h5>
<ul>
<li>Try to reschedule for within the next 1-2 days if possible.</li>
<li>Make sure the child still will be within the age window (within 1 week of 12, 18, or 24 months) on the new test date.</li>
<li>The Test Date on Databrary should be the date the 1-hour natural play was done (so updated it if needed). Keep the same subject number.</li>
<li>Give the mother participant payment in full amount on both visits.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>FAQ about data collection</h2>
<div id="general" class="section level3">
<h3>General</h3>
<div id="what-if-fatherpartnerauntnannyetc.-is-there" class="section level5">
<h5>What if father/partner/aunt/nanny/etc. is there?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Usually mom says [PERSON] is going to leave.<br />
</li>
<li>If mom doesn’t appear to send [PERSON] out, then say: <say>We just want to double check that you’re ok with being alone with the child for the first 90 minutes of this visit. As we mentioned earlier, we just want you and your child at home. Let us know when you’re ready for it to just be you and your child. If [PERSON] needs more time to leave, we could start with questionnaires. </say></li>
<li>If other person needs to be in another room in the home, we want to make sure they will not interrupt the mom and child or interact with them.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="at-any-point-during-the-visit-what-if-a-major-protocol-violation-occurs-e.g." class="section level5">
<h5>At any point during the visit, what if a major protocol violation occurs? E.g.,</h5>
<ul>
<li>Another person is there during the natural interaction</li>
<li>Mom interacts with the experimenter repeatedly during the recording</li>
<li>You learn something about child’s disability status or language that excludes them from the study</li>
<li>Mom or child engages in some other behavior that would invalidate the visit</li>
</ul>
<p>Conduct the study as usual, complete all steps in procedure. The session won’t pass quality assurance, but parts of the video and questionnaires will be usable to someone and shared on Databrary anyway.</p>
</div>
<div id="at-any-point-during-the-visit-what-if-there-are-technical-issues-with-the-video-camera" class="section level5">
<h5>At any point during the visit, what if there are technical issues with the video camera?</h5>
<ul>
<li>If the camera won’t turn on, there is no SD card, or something else that would stop recording at all. Try to reschedule the visit.</li>
<li>If the battery runs out in the middle of the house walkthrough, structured play, or questionnaires, replace the battery and resume recording.</li>
<li>If the battery runs out in the first 5-15 minutes of the natural play, replace the battery and start the 1 hour over. (Ensure you will have enough battery power to record the rest of the home visit, otherwise record what you can and reschedule for another time.)</li>
<li>If the battery runs out past 15 minutes of the natural play, reschedule the visit for another time to ensure you can record everything.</li>
<li>If it occurs within approximately the first 15 minutes of the study, ask the mom if it would be possible to reschedule. Remember to be apologetic and professional.<br />
</li>
<li>If it occurs in the middle of the session, continue with the rest of the visit to the best of your ability and if necessary, “fake” the recording. Experimenter should make note of what happened in the post-visit notes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="at-any-point-during-the-visit-what-if-the-experimenter-feels-unsafe-or-uncomfortable" class="section level5">
<h5>At any point during the visit, what if the experimenter feels unsafe or uncomfortable?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Experimenter’s safety should be considered above the completion of the home visit.<br />
</li>
<li>Explain to mom that you are feeling unwell and cannot complete the visit. Remember to be apologetic and professional while doing so (For example, <say> I’m not feeling great right now. I’m so sorry but I don’t think that I will be able to finish the rest of the visit. I’m really sorry for the inconvenience. </say>)<br />
</li>
<li>If mom has already signed the study permission form, experimenter should still provide subject payment (if possible) before leaving. (For example, <say> Again, I’m really sorry about this. We will definitely still pay you for this visit though. Can you please sign this form?</say>)<br />
</li>
<li>Experimenter should make a note of what happened in the post-visit notes.</li>

<h5>What if the child keeps trying to interact with me?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Don’t look directly at the child. If you need to look at the child, look at them through video recording screen.</li>
<li>Children will usually try to do this during the first 5-10 mins of your visit. Do not interact with them.</li>
<li>If child tries to hand you something, take a step back. If child is looking at you, do not move and look away. Try to move back and put space between you and child. If necessary, move behind furniture or record from another room.</li>
<li>If child persists in interacting with you, keep recording. Be sure to make notes in Clean Up.</li>

<ul>
<li>If the experimenter is unable to go over all the questionnaires during the visit (because the mother does not have time, the child is irritable and mother asks to finish, or there is another reason why you cannot continue) schedule a video call to complete remotely. The administration of the locomotor milestones, language/vocabulary measures, and Databrary form MUST be done in the home.</li>
<li>Guidelines for completing the questionnaires on a video call:
<ul>
<li>The call must be done within 48 hours of the home visit.</li>
<li>Remind the mother of the agreement level she signed on the Databrary form and confirm that she agrees to share the video call with the rest of the data. Say <say>Just as a reminder, the videos collected today are part of the data we collected during our home visit. You agreed to share the data on Databrary, an online video library were only authorized users have access, with other RESEARCHERS (AND IMAGES FOR PRESENTATIONS [IF APPLIES]). Do you agree to share this video recording as part of the data?</say></li>
<li>Video call must be <strong>recorded</strong> with mom in view and uploaded with the rest of the data from the visit. Label the file as <b>PLAY_SITE_###_Questionnaires_remote</b> (e.g. PLAY_NYUNI_024_Questionnaires_remote)</li>
<li>Share your screen so that the mother can see the questionnaires and scales when it applies.</li>
<li>The questionnaire must be completed on the same KoboToolBox session and form that was started in the home.</li>
