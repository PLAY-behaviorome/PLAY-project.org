</div>


<p><br></p>
<div id="coding-overview-and-setup" class="section level1">
<h1>Coding overview and setup</h1>
<p>The collaborating sites in PLAY perform a variety of roles (see <a href="people.html">people</a> for details). Each site that performs a <strong>coding</strong> role is pre-assigned to complete one or more coding functions (see in yellow below). This webpage contains detailed help for coding set up, workflow, and step-by-step procedures for each coding function.</p>
<p><img src="img/overview-coding.png" width="600"></p>
<div id="quality-assurance" class="section level3">
<h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
<p>All videos that are coded with go through a quality assurance process in which the PLAY team will ensure that the coded videos are eligible to be included in the final sample. Videos that pass QA will be checked for reliability, merged, and added to the final PLAY dataset. Coded videos that don’t pass QA will be sent back to the coding site for recoding. In some cases, the coding site might be provided additional training.</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-started" class="section level3">
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>To code videos, you will need: * access to Databrary, the video repository that will contain files to be coded * a downloaded version of Datavyu, a video-coding application * coding templates and scripts</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Download</strong> the <a href="http://datavyu.org/download.html">development version of Datavyu</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Download</strong> the <em>PLAY_CodingTemplate.opf</em> file from the <a href="https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/254/slot/14924/-?asset=73892">PLAY Databrary Volume</a>. Name this file with the PLAY naming convention (e.g., <em>PLAY_NYU001, … PLAY_NYU010, … PLAY_NYU030</em>).
<ul>
<li>This template contains all of the primary variables that will be coded by each site: communication, gesture, locomotion, object interaction, and emotion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Download</strong> Ruby scripts for each coding variable as needed from the <a href="https://github.com/databrary/PLAY-Project-Datavyu-scripts">PLAY Github repository</a>.</li>
<li>Familiarize yourself with Datavyu before you begin coding (resources on Datavyu.org, videos from past workshops, etc.).
<ul>
<li>Refer to the <a href="http://www.datavyu.org/user-guide/index.html">Datavyu User Guide</a>.</li>
<li>Take a look at our <a href="http://www.datavyu.org/user-guide/best-practices.html">Best Practices for Coding Behavioral Data From Video</a> on the Datavyu site.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="coding-in-passes" class="section level3">
<h3>Coding in Passes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The coding manual describes the transcription process and codes for 5 content areas: communication, gesture, locomotion, object interaction, and emotion.</li>
<li>Each content area includes two passes: one pass for the infant and one pass for the mother. <em>For gesture alone, the child and mom are coded together in a single pass.</em></li>
<li>A <em>pass</em> entails scoring the relevant codes for 1-hour of video.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please visit our <a href="https://github.com/databrary/PLAY-Project-Datavyu-scripts">GitHub Repository</a> for all of the scripts mentioned in this wiki. <br><br></p>

<div id="communication-passes" class="section level1">
<h1>Communication passes</h1>
<div id="workflow" class="section level2">
<h2>1. Workflow</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You will receive video files that have been <a href="https://dev1.ed-projects.nyu.edu/wikis/docuwiki/doku.php/transcription">transcribed</a> by the PLAY team. Run two additional scripts that will prepare new <a href="https://dev1.ed-projects.nyu.edu/wikis/docuwiki/doku.php/manual2">Communication</a> columns for further coding.</li>
<li><strong>Run</strong> <em>splitmomchild_transcribe.rb</em>. This script pulls out mom and child language from the <em><em>transcribe</em></em> column into two new columns: (1) <em><em>momspeech</em></em> and (2) <em><em>childvoc</em></em> . Each column is automatically populated with cells from the respectively tagged utterances from the <em><em>transcribe</em></em> column (e.g., the script ports all utterances coded as ‘m’ to the <em><em>momspeech</em></em> column and ‘b’ to the <em><em>childvoc</em></em> column). Each new cell in <em><em>momspeech</em></em> and <em><em>childvoc</em></em> is a point cell created at the onset of each cell from the transcription.</li>
<li><strong>Run</strong> <em>create_momchild_utterancetype.rb</em>. This script also creates two new columns: (1) <em><em>momutterancetype</em></em> and (2) <em><em>childutterancetype</em></em> . For each cell in <em><em>momspeech</em></em> and <em><em>childvoc</em></em> , a new cell is created in <em><em>momutterancetype</em></em> and <em><em>childutterancetype</em></em> , respectively. The codes for these cells are blank, and the coder now scores mom and child communication according to definitions in <a href="https://dev1.ed-projects.nyu.edu/wikis/docuwiki/doku.php/manual2">Communication Codes</a>. <br><br></li>

Once the proper code has been found, enter it into the prompt you are at, then code all of the rest as periods ”.”. For instance, if the child didn’t speak in full speech, or speech-like sound, but did cry/scream, then code &lt;.,.,c,.&gt;.</p>
<p>The transcript will expedite this process. Double check and listen again as you read the transcript. Comment any disagreements.</p>

<div id="operational-definitions" class="section level5">
<h5>Operational Definitions</h5>
<p><code>&lt;s&gt;</code></p>
<p>Sentence = an utterance in which the speaker utters more than one word, producing a sentence or phrase (e.g., “Daddy’s shoe” or “Go to the park”). <a href=""> 3 videos (“ooh gimme that”, “i take this”, “goodbye sad face?”) </a></p>
<p><code>&lt;w&gt;</code></p>
<p>Word = an utterance in which the speaker utters a single word, such as “dolly” or “ball.” <a href=""> 3 videos (“car”, “basketball”, “truck”) </a></p>
<p><code>&lt;b&gt;</code></p>
<p>Babble = an utterance in which the speaker utters a series of repeated canonical syllables, such as ba-ba-ba, or ga-ga-ga. <a href=""> 3 videos (all “b”) </a></p>
<p><code>&lt;v&gt;</code></p>
<p>Vowel = an utterance in which the speaker utters a vowel sound (e.g, /a/, /i:/). <a href=""> 3 videos (all “v”) </a></p>
<p><code>&lt;c&gt;</code></p>
<p>Cry= an utterance in which the speaker is experiencing a period of prolonged distress. <a href=""> 3 videos (all “c”) </a></p>
<p><code>&lt;g&gt;</code></p>
<p>Grunt= an utterance in which the speaker produces a low, short, inarticulate, guttural sound often used to express effort or exertion. Vegetative sounds, such as coughing and sneezing, should be captured using this code. <a href=""> 2 videos (both “g”) </a></p>
<p><code>&lt;x&gt;</code></p>
<p>Unintelligible = either what the child said was not intelligible to the transcriber, or after listening you are not able to understand well enough what they say even with the transcript to properly code it.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-code-2" class="section level5">
<h5>How to Code</h5>
<p>Set the “JUMP-BACK-BY” to 2 s.</p>
<p>Hit “FIND” on the controller to go to the onset of each utterance, which was populated in childvoc column. JUMP-BACK-BY 2 s so the utterance can be viewed in context.</p>
<p>Play in real time to code each utterance, which is coded in mutually exclusive categories. TAB to between each argument/prompt inserting period “.” until you reach the appropriate code. Then insert periods to the end of the cell.</p>
</div>

<h5>General Orientation</h5>
<p>Utterance type = categorization of previously coded utterances as a specific type of speech form. Read the utterance transcribed in <code>momspeech</code> column and categorize each utterance based on codes below.</p>
<p>Codes are mutually exclusive. The prompts/arguments in the code are designed to speed the coder through the easiest to detect and easiest to code categories (imperatives, then interrogatives, declaratives, etc.) down through the more nuanced and time-consuming codes. After the proper code has been found, enter it into the prompt you are at, then code all of the rest as periods “.”. For instance, if the mom didn’t do an imperative, sing/read, but did give a declarative, then code &lt;.,d,.,.&gt;.</p>
<p>What is coded is not solely based on the transcript. Listen to the audio, watch the video, and read the transcript so you are sure of the intent behind the mom’s speech.</p>

<h5>Operational Definitions</h5>
<p><code>&lt;l&gt;</code></p>
<p>Imperative Look = an utterance in which the speaker directs a child’s attention (e.g., “Look here”, “See?”, or calls child’s name to alert attention). <a href=""> 2 videos (“evelyn”, “look”) </a></p>
<p><code>&lt;a&gt;</code></p>
<p>Imperative Act = an utterance in which the speaker directs a child’s action, such as asking child to do something, or to play with an object. An example would be if a mother tells her child “let’s play with the ball”. <a href=""> 3 videos (“turn the page”, “come here please”, “go get the basketball”) </a></p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The imperative look and imperative act can be collapsed if the breakdown takes too long to code/specify (although we don’t think it will save time).</p>
<p><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></p>
<p>Imperative Prohibit = an utterance in which the speaker prohibits a child’s behavior, such as asking child to stop what they’re doing. <a href=""> 3 videos (“dont knock it over”, “dont be so rough”, “no no tv”) </a></p>
<p><code>&lt;i&gt;</code></p>
<p>Interrogative = an utterance in which the speaker asks for information about objects or ongoing activities (e.g., “What is this called?”, “What color is this?). Questions that start with “Can you” or “Would you” (e.g., “Can you put that down”) should not be considered for interrogatives. Their function is to regulate the child’s behavior and should be coded as imperatives. Tag questions, in which the speaker adds a question at the end of a statement (“That’s a blue truck, right?”) are not considered questions. These should be coded as declaratives. <a href=""> 2 videos (“what does the pig say?”, “what is this?”) </a></p>
<p><code>&lt;d&gt;</code></p>

<h5>Operational Definitions</h5>
<p><code>&lt;source_m-b&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>&lt;m&gt;</code>: Code ‘m’ if the mom is the source of the gesture.</p>
<p><code>&lt;b&gt;</code>: Code ‘b’ if the child is the source of the gesture.</p>
<p><code>&lt;gesture_p-s-i-c&gt;</code></p>
<p>Gesturing by either mom or child <em>to the investigator</em> (or anyone else in the room) should not be coded. The following should <em>NOT</em> be coded as gestures: tapping child to get his/her attention; pushing an object away; hugging and kissing; one partner moving the other’s hand (e.g., to initiate contact, like proximity seeking); jerking the head to indicate “come here.”</p>
<p><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></p>
<p>Code ‘<strong>p</strong>’ when the child or mom extends their index finder to indicate reference to objects, people, events, or locations in the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Onset</strong> is the frame when the finger is fully extended in space toward a referent, or when the point finger is extended and makes contact with the object. Repetitive points should be coded as separate gesture events.</p>
<p><code>&lt;s&gt;</code></p>
<p>Code ‘<strong>s</strong>’ when the child or mom holds up an object to present it as if to say: “look at this” or “do you want this” or “I want you to take this”. Given that it’s not possible to distinguish intention, when a participant shows, offers, or gives an object (e.g., child actually hands toy to mom, offering toy to mom but mom doesn’t take) code as ‘s’, to save decision-making time.</p>
<p><strong>Onset</strong> is the frame when the object is fully held up or out to show it. Repetitive instances of holding up or offering an object should be coded as separate gesture events.</p>
<p><code>&lt;i&gt;</code></p>
<p>Code ‘<strong>i</strong>’ when the child or mom engages in an iconic gesture. They are called iconic because they represent an object, idea, or action that can’t easily be referenced with a deictic (point/show) or conventional gesture. The movement of these gestures usually calls to mind something about the nature of the object, idea or action being referenced. For example, you could move your arms back and forth to represent running, or you could trace a square in the air with your finger, or flap your arms as if flying.</p>
<p><strong>Onset</strong> is the frame when the child or mom has clearly begun the iconic gesture, and the coder can clearly identify this a gesture but does fall into the conventional gesture category (see <code>&lt;c&gt;</code>). Repetitive instances of an iconic gesture should be coded as separate gesture events.</p>
<p><code>&lt;c&gt;</code></p>
<p>Code ‘c’ when the child or mom engages in a conventional gesture. Conventional gestures are culturally-agreed-upon hand or head movements with a specific meaning, like nodding the head to mean “yes,” shaking the head to mean “no,” and moving the finger to lips to indicate “be quiet”. <a href=""> 2 videos (shaking head “no”; holding out hand for “give me”) </a></p>
<p>If a gesture is conventional, you should be able to understand its meaning just by seeing it in isolation, without knowing any of the context. Some additional examples of conventional gestures include: waving, clapping, flipping arms out to side to indicate “I don’t know’ or “where is it”, come here gesture (finger motions or palms), sit down gesture (pats ground), pickup gesture (child holds up arms to be picked up), thumbs up, shrugs, naughties (wag finger), hug me (hold arms out asking for hug), etc.</p>
<p><strong>Onset</strong> is the frame when the child or mom has clearly begun the conventional gesture, and the coder can clearly identify this a gesture but does fall into the iconic gesture category (see <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>). Repetitive instances of a conventional gesture should be coded as separate gesture events.</p>

<div id="how-to-code-4" class="section level5">
<h5>How to Code</h5>
<p>Set “JUMP-BACK-BY” key to 2 s.</p>
<p>Gestures are best coded with the volume low or muted so that the language content does not confound the coding process.</p>
<p>Watch in <strong>1x speed</strong> until either mom or child gestures. Focus on the mom’s and infant’s hands and head to identify instances of gestures.</p>
<p>Gestures are defined purely as they relate to the communicative nature of each action. The coder can establish whether something is <em>communicative</em> by looking at things like eye contact, conversational context, and the reaction of the person being spoken or gestured to. If the movement isn’t supposed to communicate anything, then it’s not a gesture. For example, a child might reach for an object and pick it up and look at it. This is an action, not a gesture. But, if the child points to the object to indicate its presence, or if the parent claps her hands to indicate “good job,” then these are gestures. (If there is significant ambiguity in whether a gesture is communicative, or how to code it, sound may be of assistance.)</p>
<p>When the coder identifies a mom or child gesturing, jump back <strong>2 seconds</strong> and play the video again at <strong>½ speed</strong> until the frame the gesture is clearly underway is found. Hit the = key (equal sign) to insert a point cell; so the current video frame becomes the onset and the offset.</p>
<p>Type <strong>‘m’</strong> or <strong>‘b’</strong> to indicate whether mom of the child was the <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> of the gesture. Hit the TAB key to advance the cursor to <code>&lt;gesture&gt;</code>, then type <strong>‘p’</strong>, <strong>‘s’</strong>, <strong>‘i’</strong>, or <strong>‘c’</strong> to indicate the type of gesture.</p>

<h5>
General rules for coding “<b>l</b>”
</h5>
<p>Code <b>l</b> when the baby is engaged in self-generated locomotion in any form (i.e. bum shuffling, scooting, belly crawling, hands-knees crawling, hands-feet crawling, cruising, supported walking, independent walking, marching in place, jumping, hopping, etc.). <br> <br> <b>l</b> occurs when the entire body is displaced in any direction—forward, sideways, backward, in-place—space because the baby is taking a “step”. A baby takes a “step” by shifting weight from one foot/knee onto the other (i.e., weight must be shifting onto a swinging foot/knee in the air to count as moving; if not, this is stationary). <br><br> This code counts locomotion regardless of whether the baby maintains balance independently or the baby’s balance is supported by a parent or external object/apparatus. This code also counts even if the child is taking uncontrolled steps while losing balance (i.e. stumbling steps before a fall). Any self-generated locomotion where the child is using a toy, baby walker, furniture, etc. for support and pushing or moving the object, counts as locomotion. (If child is on top and riding a toy with wheels, this does not count as locomotion. See rules for riding). <br></p>
<p><br> <b>(a) If child is upright:</b><br> If child is upright on both feet without support, every step counts. NOTE: Do not include pivots. Be careful of bouts that start or end with “pivots” – part of baby’s foot moving but the entire foot is not displaced (e.g. toes move in air but heel rotates on floor, heel moves in air while toes rotate on floor). If a bout start or ends with one of these pivots, do not include pivot movements as part of the locomotion bout. <br> <br> <b>(b) If child is upright but using a surface for support:</b> <br>If child is upright on both feet while supported by furniture, toy, or mom, the duration of each step has be less than or equal to 1 sec. If the child is using hands for support while swinging one leg for more than 1 sec, do not code as locomotion. We want to exclude time when the child is not locomoting but one foot is in the air for an extended period of time (&gt;1s). <br><br> <b>(c) If child is NOT upright:</b> <br>If child is not upright on both feet (e.g., crawling on belly, hands knees crawling, bum shuffling, etc.) then a bout has to include 3 or more consecutive steps with foot, knee, or bum to count as locomotion. Do not try to code one bum shuffle (child scoots bum back once while sitting on the floor) or one crawl step (moves the knee one time when on the floor). Most likely that is just a shift of position or the beginning of a transition (which is not coded. See rules for transitions). <br><br> <u>NOTE for hands/feet crawling</u>: <br> For hands/feet crawling, both hands need to be on the floor. So if the first or last step only has one hand on the floor, consider this a transition. Crawling can be a mix between knee and foot crawling. Code onset based on which body part begins the movement (foot or knee). <br><br> <u>NOTE for belly crawling or bum shuffling</u>: <br> Only code locomotion if the baby makes at least 3 reliable belly-crawling movements (RARE). <br><br> <b>(d) Do not include any transitions</b> <br>Do not include any movement with foot/knee as part of a transition to another posture (e.g., sit to upright/walk, sit to crawl). The first walking/crawling step will be when the foot/knee moves forward in any direction. The final step in the bout has to be a real walking/crawling step (i.e., it is not the last half step or little attempt-step that looks like a transition into the sit). For example, if the baby transitions from sitting to crawling; the first step is after the transition ends and the last step is just before another transition begins. Do not include any time baby is rolling (either on furniture or floor). This is not a reliable source of locomotion and is often part of a transition. <br><br> <u>NOTE for climbing onto/down from furniture</u>: <br> - Getting down from furniture: If baby bum shuffles or slides to get off of furniture, consider this a transition and therefore do not code until both of baby’s feet have landed on floor. <br> - Climbing onto furniture: If child is locomoting and climbs onto furniture without stopping code this entire bout as locomoting. <br> If the child is locomoting on the floor and stops for more than 1 s before climbing onto the furniture (e.g. child walks up to the couch, lifts one leg and stops for more than 1s) then set the offset of the locomotion bout when child stops. After child climbs onto the furniture, the child could transition to stationary (don’t code this as locomotion) OR start a new bout of locomotion (remember only code crawling if 3 or more steps). <br><br> <u>NOTE for locomoting up/down stairs:</u> <br> If the child is going up/down stairs in any manner (walking, crawling, belly-crawling, bum shuffling), count all possible locomotion using regular locomotion codes. Stairs are different from climbing onto/down from furniture note above.</p>
<h5>
Setting the Onset &amp; Offset of a locomotion bout:
</h5>
<p><b>Onset</b> of an upright “locomotion bout” is the first frame when the whole foot is displaced. The foot doesn’t necessarily have to come off the ground, but the foot has to slide forward, backward or sideways. The onset for a non-upright “locomotion bout” is the first frame when the knee/foot or bum is displaced in space. <br> <b>Offset</b> is the frame when the baby takes the last step before a 1s pause.</p>

<h5>
General rules for coding “<b>f</b>”
</h5>
<p>Code <b>f</b> if the baby loses control over his/her body (i.e., balance) and cannot recover on his/her own before his/her body hits the ground. If the baby loses balance, but catches him/herself before the above body parts hit the ground, do not count as a fall. <br><br> All falls count. They can happen while upright, on/off furniture or other elevation, while sitting, or while engaged in locomotion (walking or crawling). Falls can happen while the mom is holding the baby’s hand or while the baby is holding onto furniture or another support. <br><br> A loss of balance must occur before any of the body parts hit the ground. The baby must be out of his/her own control. Sometimes babies will actively choose to drop to the floor (e.g., jumping and dropping, flopping down from a couch to the floor, plopping down into a sit, where they let themselves fall down into a sitting position) should NOT count as a fall. <br><br> Parent involved falls would only be coded as a fall if the parent catches the baby after the baby loses balance, effectively supporting the baby’s entire weight. In this scenario, the baby would have fallen if not for parent rescue (i.e., the body part would have hit the ground). Parents must catch after the baby has begun to lose balance. If the parent was already supporting the baby’s weight before a loss of balance, but baby’s body parts (e.g., hands, head, butt, etc.) do not touch the ground, then this is not a fall (it is supported walking). <br><br> Falling can occur immediately after mom-constrained if mom and child fell together. Falling can occur immediately after device-constrained if device tips over or the mechanism of constraint fails. Falling can occur immediately after riding if falls off of the riding device. <br></p>
<h5>
Setting the Onset &amp; Offset for falls:
</h5>
<p>Falls can be coded as separate events (child is standing stationary and then falls) or immediately following another code (child is locomoting and then falls). There should only be 1ms between the previous code and the onset of the falling event if the fall ends the previous code. <br> <indent><b>Onset</b> is the first frame when child begins to lose balance.</indent><br> <indent><b>Offset</b> when child’s body (as defined below) hits the floor.</indent> <br> <br> From an <b>upright or squatting</b> position: a loss of balance results in the hands, knees, or a toy in the hands hitting the ground; baby’s bum hitting the ground; or head hitting the ground. <br> From a <b>crawling</b> position: a loss of balance results in the face, head, chest, or side of torso hitting the ground. <br> From a <b>sitting</b> position: a loss of balance results in the head, chest, side of torso, or back hitting the ground.</p>

General rules for coding “<b>m</b>”
</h5>
<p>Code <b>m</b> when the child is being constrained and supported by the mother. The child’s feet are not on the ground and is being held in the air by the mother. The mother’s arms are supplying support to the child’s body. During a mother constraint, the mother can be moving (carrying) or stationary (holding). <br><br> NOTE: Code as ‘m’ if mother has placed the baby on a surface but is still supporting the child such that the child would not be able to locomote (e.g. child sitting on kitchen counter and mom holding. While the child’s full weight is not supported by mom, the baby is being constrained by mom and could not locomote. <br><br> NOTE: Do not count mother constraint when the child is just sitting on the mother’s lap or child is next to mom sitting on the couch — the child could get up and locomote if he/she wanted. However, if child is on the mom’s lap and their feet are hanging far of the floor (e.g. mom is sitting on a couch and child is on her lap, and child’s legs are dangling in front of the couch). <br></p>
<h5>
Setting the Onset &amp; Offset of a mom-constrained bout:
</h5>
<p><b>Onset</b> of “mom-constrained” is the first frame when mom lifts up the baby’s whole body off the current surface and up into the air in mom’s arms (as defined below). <br>From an <b>upright or squatting</b> position: when child’s second foot leaves the surface. <br>From <b>lying down on back</b>: when bum leaves the surface of support. <br>From <b>lying on tummy</b>: when tummy leaves the surface of support. <br>From a <b>crawling</b> position: second knee/foot leaves the surface of support. <br>From a <b>sitting</b> position: when bum leaves the surface of support. <br>NOTE: If child is sitting on mom’s lap and mom gets up holding child, the onset is when mom starts to get up (when mom’s bum leaves the surface). <br><br> <b>Offset</b> of “mom-constrained” is when mom places baby down and the baby starts supporting own weight in any posture (as defined below). <br>Mom places child in <b>upright</b> position: when both feet touch the ground. <br>Mom places child <b>lying down on back</b>: when bum touches the surface. This is usually the case when mom puts child on the changing table. <br>Mom places child <b>lying down on tummy</b>: when tummy touches the surface. <br>Mom places child in <b>crawling or kneeling</b> position: when both knees touch the ground. <br>Mom places child in <b>sitting</b> position: when child’s bum touches the surface of support. <br>This can be a chair, highchair, furniture, floor, or mother’s lap. For mom’s lap offset is when child’s bum touches the mom’s lap, not when the mom’s hands release the child (the mom could continue to hold the child after the bum touches the mom’s lap). <br><br> NOTE for when transitioning from “mom-constrained” to “device-constraint” to “mom-constrained” (‘m’, ‘d’, ‘m’): <br>“Mom held” and “device-constraint” are likely to be continuous. Mom-constraint ends as she puts baby into device. Mom takes baby out of device is device-constraint transitioning into mom-constraint. <br>These should be continuous coding with 1ms between each code. Do not wait until baby is fully strapped and buckled on device (See onset codes above). <br><br> NOTE for when transitioning from “locomotion” to “mom-constrained” to “locomotion” (‘l’, ‘m’, ‘l’): <br><u>In cases of “locomotion” followed by “mom-constrained”</u> Offset for ‘l’ should be the last real step before mom lifts baby of the surface. Codes for ‘l’ and ‘m’ can be continuous but not always are. <br><br> <u>In cases of “mom-constrained” followed by “locomotion”</u> <br>If baby immediately starts locomoting when mom is putting the baby back down, the onset for ‘l’ is when the second foot, hand, or knee touches the floor.</p>

<h5>
General rules for coding “<b>d</b>”
</h5>
<p>Code ‘<b>d</b>’ if the child is constrained (could be strapped or not) in a device that <b>restricts locomotion</b> (e.g., a highchair, stroller, car seat, etc.). The device could restrict locomotion by binding the child from the front or sides (bumbo seat), lifting them off the ground (high chair, changing table), constraining their freedom to move upright (car seat, stroller), or strapped in. Device can never be household furniture (e.g. couch, chair, or bed) not intended for children. Child-designed furniture (e.g. wooden or plastic child chair) is not a device unless the child is strapped into it and locomotion is restricted. <br> <indent>NOTE: Child walker is not a device. This would count as supported walking because that’s the whole point of a child walker. Jolly jumpers and exersaucers count as a device even though the child is moving or jumping around because this restricts locomotion.</indent> <br><b>For devices that always restricts locomotion (with or without straps):</b> if the device restricts locomotion regardless of whether the child is strapped in or not (e.g. highchair with bounded sides, tall stroller, bumbo seat) code as ‘d’ when child is on the device, not when straps are buckled. <br><b>For child-designed furniture that restricts locomotion only when child is strapped in:</b> If child-designed furniture only restricts locomotion because the child is strapped in (e.g. child chair that the child could get on/off independently) then code as ‘d’ when and only when the child is strapped in. Onset is when the first strap is buckled and offset is when the last strap is unbuckled. Do not code the time when the child is stationary and free to initiate locomotion from the piece of furniture. <br><b>For ride toys that restricts locomotion when child is strapped in:</b> If ride toy only restricts locomotion because the child is strapped in (e.g. a toy like stroller), then code as ‘d’ when and only when the child is strapped in. <br><b>For changing tables:</b> If mom places the child on a changing table (off the ground), code as ‘d’ as long as the child is on the changing table. Only code mom-restrained when mom picks up child from floor and puts on the changing table, and when mom picks up child from changing table and puts him/her back on the floor. Do not code ‘d’ when mom is changing the child on a changing mat on the floor (follow rules for mom-restrained if mom picks child up or locomotion rules if child starts crawling or walking). <br> <indent>NOTE for when transitioning from “mom-constrained” to “device-constraint” to “mom-constrained” (‘m’, ‘d’, ‘m’): <br>“Mom held” and “device-constraint” are likely to be continuous. Mom-constraint ends as she puts baby into device. Mom takes baby out of device is device-constraint transitioning into mom-constraint. <br>These should be continuous coding with 1ms between each code. Do not wait until baby is fully strapped and buckled on device unless the straps are the only method of restricting locomotion, then treat unbuckled part as stationary.<indent></p>

Hit ENTER to create a new cell at this <b>Onset.</b> <br><br> Now, watch in real time to see when the baby stops moving. The <b>Offset</b> is when the baby stops moving for at least 1 s (the pause has to look and feel like an actual pause when you are watching in real time; don’t simply end a bout of locomotion because there was a 1-s pause, especially if it looks like the baby is about to take another step). The first frame when the foot/knee stops moving or when the foot settles into its final position (sometimes infants stop their walking bout on their tip-toes) is the offset. The same applies to sliding steps. <br><br> To set the <b>Offset</b>, use the same rules for mechanics as with the onset. Hit #5-STOP and then hit “JUMP-BACK-BY” to go back to the timestamp that is just before the lift. Then JOG forward by hitting #3-JOGFORWARD until you reach the <b>Offset</b> of that cell. If you go to far, you can JOG backward by hitting #1-JOGBACK. You will likely have to hit the JOG keys numerous times.

When child begins moving, use jump-back button to go back to onset of locomotion. THIS WILL SAVE YOU TIME! Child may make small movements during this time to re-adjust body position, but if movements are less than 3 steps on bum or knees, do not slow down to code them as these would be ignored as per coding rules discussed above. <br></p>

<p><strong>Object</strong> = is defined as any manipulable, moveable item that may be detached and moved through space (e.g., toys, household items, and smaller moveable elements of larger objects like beads on busy box, doorknob) <a href=""> (2 videos) </a>. Objects may include large objects (i.e., a stroller, adult furniture, door, etc.) when child moves them, thus, manually engaging with them. If the object never moves (e.g., the child has a hand on the stroller but does not displace it), then this is not coded as ‘o.’ <a href=""> (1 video) </a> The displacement rule is so that we can differentiate object engagement episodes from instances where child is exploring a surface or resting hands on a surface for support. <a href=""> (1 video) </a> The infant does not have to be looking at the object for the event to count as an object engagement (e.g., child is carrying object) <a href=""> (1 video) </a>.</p>
<p>Riding on toys with wheels does not count as object, but this will be coded in <em>childloc</em> pass.</p>
<p>Code ‘<strong>o</strong>’ if the child is engaged with an object by making contact with the item with hand(s) and/or moving the item in space (e.g., carrying, pushing on the floor, etc.) <a href=""> (1 video) </a></p>
<p><strong>Onset</strong> is the frame when child first causes the object to move while making contact with any part of the hand(s), not feet. Contact could be from any part of the hand (fingers, palm, side of hand). Movement could including lifting, holding, pressing, grasping, shaking, banging, or any other type of displacement event. DO NOT code onset, just when the hand touches the object if the object is not displaced (e.g., if they child touches a pillow but then 1 minute later actually grasps and moves it, code onset at the movement not when the hand touches the object). <strong>Offset</strong> is the frame when child is no longer in manual contact with an object for at least 3 s. OR when the child is in manual contact but the object is no longer being displaced (displacement includes holding, lifting) for at least 3 s. There is no minimum duration for child to touch an object to be scored as ‘o,’ but if infant is touching multiple objects, the offset of ‘o’ object cell is when child is no longer in manual contact with the last object contacted for 3+ s. If the child is in manual contact with an object in one hand and makes contact with another object with their second hand, count this as the same bout. <a href=""> (1 video) </a></p>

Look for lowering of the corners of the mouth, stretching and tautness of the lips, along with closing of the eyes because of furrowed brow. If there is any doubt that the child is showing negative emotion, then do not begin the code.</p>
<p>Do not defer to the voice to code negative emotion when the face is visible. If the child’s face is clearly not visible (i.e. missing), then ‘n’ can be coded if the child is displaying clear negative emotion through their voice. The child could be screaming, crying, or yelling. If there is any doubt whether the voice is negative, then do not begin the code.</p>
<p><em>Onset</em></p>
<p>Onset of an emotion event is the first frame the child is clearly displaying positive/negative emotion through the face. The onset does not need to be completely frame accurate, since emotion could begin in any part of the face. The coder is looking to identify when any lay person would absolutely agree the child is showing positive/negative emotion based on the face.</p>
<p>There is no criterion for how long an emotion event should be. It is easy for the coder to mark the first frame when they see clear positive/negative emotion, even if it ends a few frames later. Events that are later deemed “too brief” could be removed via scripting.</p>
<p>When coding ‘n’ from voice during missing time, set the onset when the negative voice starts and end the ‘n’ code when the voice ends. The onset/offset do not need to be frame accurate. For cases when emotion code begins right out of missing: The face has not been visible and the first frame you can see the face again the infant is clearly displaying positive/negative emotion. Code the onset of the emotion code as the first frame when the face reappears. Use the “0” key to set the onset of the emotion event and simultaneously set the offset of ‘missing’. We want to preserve the 1ms difference between ‘missing’ and the emotion code so we can know that that ‘missing’ event was ended because of the onset of an emotion code.</p>
<p><em>Offset</em></p>
<p>Offset of a positive/negative emotion is the first frame the child is clearly back to a neutral emotion through the face. The offset does not need to completely frame accurate, since emotion could end in any part of the face. The coder is looking to identify when any lay person would absolutely agree the child is no longer showing any positive/negative emotion based on the face.</p>
<p>If the child’s face returns to neutral for less than 5 frames during one emotion code (e.g. positive, then neutral for 4 frames, then back to positive), continue the ‘p’ or ‘n’ code. The coder would have to expend unneeded effort to identify and tag those offsets and onsets time, since reliability does not need to be frame accurate.</p>
<p>For cases when emotion code is ended by missing: The emotion event may or may not have ended but the coder can no longer see the face to code offset. Code the offset as the first frame the face completely is not visible (see ‘missing’ code below). Use “0” key to set the offset of emotion and simultaneously code the onset of ‘missing’. We want to preserve the 1ms difference between the emotion code and ‘missing’ so we can know that that ‘missing’ event caused the offset of that emotion event.</p>
<p><code>&lt;.&gt;</code></p>
<p>Code ‘.’ for missing when the child’s face is completely not visible. The child’s full face could turned away from the camera, child’s head is completely off camera, or the child is out of frame entirely. If the coder could see the emotion the child is expressing in their face from a side or oblique angle, then do not code missing.</p>
<p>If the face is not visible but the child is displaying clear negative emotion in the voice (e.g., child crying or screaming) then the missing code is ended and ‘n’ is coded (see ‘n’ code). Positive emotion cannot be coded by voice.</p>
<p>Onset is the first frame in which the coder clearly cannot see the face. Offset is the first frame in which the coder can clearly see the face again. The onset and offset do not need to be completely frame accurate, since reliability does not need to be exact from accurate.</p>
<p>If the child’s face was ‘missing’ and then reappeared for less than 5 frames, don’t stop the ‘.’ code to mark those few frames.</p>

<h5>How to Code</h5>
<p>Set “JUMP-BACK-BY” key to 1 s.</p>
<p>Play with #8-PLAY in real time (1x speed) until the child changes to clear positive or clear negative emotion or the face is clearly not visible. Focus on the child’s face and do not be distracted by what the child is saying or doing.</p>
<p>Pause with #5-STOP once you have identified a clear change in emotion or that the child’s face is no longer visible at all. Shuttle back with #4-SHUTTLEBACK at 1/8-1/4x speed to identify the onset. Use the mouth and eyes as the guide to onset. Press ENTER to set the onset as the frame where any lay person would say that child is happy or sad. The coder may even feel happy or sad watching the child’s face; use this as a guide for onset.</p>
<p>Then hit #8-PLAY then #4-SHUTTLEBACK once to watch at 1/2x and look for the offset of that emotion or when the face comes completely back into view. For missing, if it seems like there may be a long stretch of missing (e.g. child has completely wandered out of the room) then watch at 1x or 2x speed—but be listening in case there is negative emotion in the voice. Pause when you identify the offset.</p>
<p>Hit #1-JOGBACK and #3-JOGFORWARD to tag the frame the child’s face is clearly not positive or not negative (returned to neutral) or the face is visible again to code emotion from.</p>
<p>Then return to real time (1x speed) with #8-PLAY to watch for the next event.</p>

<h5>General Orientation</h5>
<p>This code captures the times that the mom is clearly displaying positive or negative emotion through facial expressions. Times when the mom is in neutral emotion are not marked. Bouts of emotion as scored as events, where the grey spaces between emotion events mean the mom is neutral or emotion is unclear. Coders also mark times as “missing” when the mom’s face could not possibly be coded for emotion (e.g., face completely turned away from camera, mom’s head out of the video). When the mom’s face is clearly not visible, negative emotion may be coded only if there is absolute clear vocal affect (e.g., mom is yelling).</p>
<p>Coders are watching/tagging the duration of each positive or negative emotion event by marking onset/offset times. To determine emotion, coders are watching the mom’s face, not vocal affect. To determine if emotion is not codeable/missing, coders are watching for when the face fully moves out of the camera view.</p>
