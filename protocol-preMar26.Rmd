# Overview

PLAY aims to set new standards for conducting open, transparent, and reproducible behavioral science by i) publishing the protocol, and ii) making extensive use of video exemplars to demonstrate phenomena and illustrate behavioral codes.
For confidentiality reasons, access to video exemplars is restricted to researchers with authorized access to [Databrary](http://databrary.org).
To register for access, visit <http://databrary.org/register>.

# Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

Infants' natural play in the home is characterized by tremendous variability including variations in: geographic location, climate, socioeconomic status (SES), maternal/paternal employment, childcare experiences, infants’ and mothers’ ages, language environment, physical layout and characteristics of the home, availability of media, toys for play, and so on. 
Researchers will be able to explore the effects of any/all such factors.

However, to ensure a sufficient sample size and based on conversations with the launch group, we will limit variability along several dimensions. To be included in the PLAY sample of 900 sessions, families must be two-parent households. 
All infants must be English or Spanish monolingual or bilingual. 
All infants must be the firstborn child and 12, 18, or 24 months of age (plus/minus one week). All infants must be full-term (37-40 weeks) without known disabilities. 
The mother must act as the caregiver during visits, which will be scheduled at a time when only the mother and infant are present in the home.

*Hi, may I speak with [MOM]?*

*My name is [CALLER NAME] and I’m calling from [LAB]. We have a study for [12 / 18 / 24]-month-olds and [CHILD] is the perfect age. Can I tell you about it?*

*What language(s) do you speak to [CHILD]?*

→ If not ENGLISH or SPANISH: end call

*To control for differences in communication, we are looking for families who speak mainly English or Spanish. Would it be alright if you are contacted for other studies in the future?*

→ If yes: continue

*For this study, we are interested in learning about babies’ natural, everyday experiences in their homes–such as the toys they play with and places they go.*
*For this study, a researcher will visit you and [CHILD] in your home.*
*You and [CHILD] will be video recorded for 1 hour as you go about your day.* 
*At the end of the visit we will ask questions about your family, your home, and [CHILD]’s skills and routines. We will also ask you to take us through your home as we do a video tour capturing the places [CHILD] gets to be throughout the day and things that [he/she] plays with.*

*The study will take about 2 hours. You will receive XXX for your participation.*
*We will schedule a day and time that’s convenient for you and when [CHILD] is usually awake/alert and not during a typical meal time.*

*The data collected in this study are valuable and will be placed in a secure web-based library available only to researchers.*
*The purpose is to share the data with experts in the field so that scientists can learn more about infant development.*

*Are you interested in participating?*

→ If yes: 

*Is there a day and time that works best for you (when [CHILD] is awake/alert and not a typical meal time)?*

→ If no: 

*Ok thank you. May we call you for other studies?*

### Voicemail

*Hi, this message is for [MOM]. My name is [NAME] and I’m calling from [LAB].*
*I’m calling because we have a fun study for [12 / 18 / 24]-month-olds and [CHILD] is the perfect age.*
*If you are interested in hearing more about the study, please give us a call back.*

Instruction to mom:

*For the next hour, do anything you would typically do if I weren’t here. Try to ignore me as much as possible and I will stay out of the way. I will also try not to respond to you and [CHILD] so that he/she is not distracted. You can go anywhere in your home. You can play together or not. The idea is to capture what your typical day is like.*

Procedure:

Keep camera on the child at all times. 
Specifically, ensure that the child’s whole body is visible on camera. If mom is in frame, capture as much of her body as possible without compromising view of the child.
Record in front or to the side of the child as much as possible.
Do not zoom in.
Remain at as far a distance as possible (~3 to 5 m, hugging the wall) so that the child is not distracted by your presence.
Try not to interact with the child or make eye contact with the child. Just watch through the view finder of the camera.

#### Shoes

```{r, results='asis'}
write_video_clip_html("https://nyu.databrary.org/slot/14765/0,6640/asset/65148/download?inline=true")
```

If child is wearing shoes, video-record the shoes after the session; take them off child and video the bottom, side, and top views.

Procedure:

Zoom in with camera and comment on shoe type, heel (if any), and other observations.

#### Decibel Meter

Open the app on your tablet and start running it just before you begin recording the free play video portion of the visit.

Procedure:

Open application (the application immediately starts recording noise levels upon startup).
Place device in the most central place in the home (e.g., living room)

### 2: Solitary Play

Interviewer:

*For the next few minutes, we want to see how [CHILD] plays by him/herself. We ask you not to distract him/her or tell him/her how to play. If [CHILD] tries to get your attention or wants to play with you, you can say, “Go play. It’s perfectly fine if he/she doesn’t play with the toy. Say to child: Here [CHILD], play with this!*

Camera:

Record solitary toy play so that view is on baby’s body entirely and hands on object.
If child moves around, follow child and keep face in frontal view.
Procedure:
Set yoga mat down on the floor. Un-stack cups and arrange randomly, standing upright (out of child’s view).
Place child in a sitting position on yoga mat and start timing after you present the toy.
Use timer on the camera (let the timer run for a bit longer than 2 min to avoid cutting the play time short. Later we code only 2 min of engagement).
After 2 minutes, say: *“Great job!”*

Instructions:

*Now, we would like to see the space that [CHILD] gets to explore throughout the day. Please give me a tour of your home as I follow with a camera, and take measurements of the spaces.*
*As we walk around, please mention the things that [CHILD] plays with in each room. Please show me where you keep his/her clothes to give us an idea of the kinds of things he/she wears.*

Procedure (Video):

Pause at the entrance of the room.

Name the room by its function (e.g., “This is where [CHILD] sleeps”).
First, pan the camera SLOWLY from Left to Right.
Then, pan the camera to Floor, name the different types of surfaces in the space (hardwood, plush carpet, thin rug, linoleum, tile, etc.), and then pan to the Ceiling.
Hold the camera in one hand while you take measurements of the room.
Do NOT turn off the camera when walking to next room.
Walk SLOWLY.

#### Room Measurements with Laser Distance Measurer

<img src="https://dev1.ed-projects.nyu.edu/wikis/docuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php/image011.png?w=300&tok=74e992"/>

Measure all rooms in the house.
Room = any space used by someone on a regular basis, including: bedrooms, kitchens, bathrooms, and basements. 
Do not measure laundry rooms. 
Rooms don’t have to have windows.
A room has to have a clear demarcation (e.g., a wall or an entry).
If the room has a short divider (e.g., when a kitchen and a living room are divided by a counter), count as one big room and measure accordingly.

Procedure:

Turn measure on by pressing ON/DIST button. 
Make sure the laser is on.
Place the base of the laser flat on the wall. 
Avoid moldings and door castings.
Measure wall to wall, lengthwise and widthwise.
If a room has an odd or asymmetrical shape (i.e., any shape other than a rectangle or a square), measure the largest rectangle or square area of the room.
Press ON/DIST again to take measurement.
Repeat the above for length and width.
Focus camera on laser measure and read measurements out loud.

### 6: Body Dimensions

[TBD]

### 7: Visit Wrap-up

Complete home measurement, housing checklist sections of the Home Questionnaire.
When you arrive back at the lab, wash all toys and equipment thoroughly. 
Wipe down yoga mat. 
Rinse nesting cups in bleach-water. 
Do not submerge shape sorter in water (or it will stop making noise).

### 8: Visit post-processing

Export questionnaire data from tablet.
Upload videos, questionnaires, and house decibel data to Databrary.
