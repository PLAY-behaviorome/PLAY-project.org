<h5>General rules for coding "<b>l</b>" for mom</h5>

Code 'l' when the mom is engaged in locomotion of any form (i.e., walking, scooting, knee-walking, crawling).
<br><br>
If you're not sure whether the mom is moving or stationary (e.g., occlusion behind furniture or unclear video footage), then this is missing data and the offset of the locomotion bout should be set to the last frame where you can see mom.
<br><br>
The subsequent cell (where you cannot see anything or make an inference about movement) should be coded as “.” until you can see mom again.
<br><br>
However, if you can infer that mom is moving or stationary (i.e., head is bobbing, shadow of the leg moving is visible, etc.) then include it in the same bout of locomotion, following the rules for pauses above.
