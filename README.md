# PLAY-behaviorome.github.io
Web site for the PLAY project.

The site is generated in R Markdown.
We acknowledge extensive use of this resource: Xie, Y., Allaire, J. J., & Grolemund, G. (2018). *R Markdown: The Definitive Guide*. CRC Press. Retrieved from https://market.android.com/details?id=book-octmDwAAQBAJ and the web-based version of the book located at <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/>.

## Rendering the site

0. Always pull from the repo before making any changes.
1. Make your changes
2. Render the website: run `rmarkdown::render_site()` in R from the project root directory
    - (If any packages need to be installed, you can do so using `install.packages("package_name")`)
    - The website files are copied to `docs/` where you can view them using a web browser or file editor.
3. If the local copy looks good, proceed to 4
4. Commit the changes - saves a local copy of the changes
    - in R, in the Git tab, you will see the files that have been changed
    - click on commit (top right)
    - type in a commit message, click on the Commit button
5. Push the changes to GitHub - saves a copy on GitHub
- click on Push (top right)
6. Check the [website](https://PLAY-behaviorome.github.io/PLAY-project.org)


(In other words: add and commit are local operations, push, pull and fetch are operations that interact with a remote. If you push without committing, nothing gets pushed. If you commit without adding, nothing gets committed. If you add without committing, nothing at all happens, git merely remembers that the changes you added should be considered for the following commit.)


## Deploying the site

From RStudio, commit the relevant changes, then push the changes to GitHub.
We use GitHub pages to serve the files pushed to the `docs/` folder.
There is a short delay between pushing the new files to GitHub and having them appear live on the site.
