**Pro tip:** The easiest way to find answers to your question is to "Find" (`Cmd+F` on a Mac or `Ctrl+F` on Windows) and type the simplest form of the word you're looking for. For example, searching for the word `dog` will bring up the FAQ "What if doorbell rings for the dog walker, delivery, etc.?"
